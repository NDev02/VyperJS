### How do I get set up? ###

Simply link the Vyper.js file into the head element inside of your html. Then all you have to do is create another link to a external file named "vyper\_project.js", this is the file containing the necessary 'Setup' and 'Draw' functions. Finally inside your HTML document create a div and give it an id of "canvasHolder" this is the place where the Vyper core will look to create your canvas. From there the rest is up to you. You can link any other external scripts and do what you want to create something AWESOME!
